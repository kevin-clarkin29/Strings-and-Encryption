# Strings-and-Encryption
## Strings and Encryption Project
'''Overview
This project is focused on implementing secure communication algorithms and data structures. The main components include a graph-based messaging system and encryption/compression functionalities, such as RSA encryption and Run-Length Encoding.

Features

Graph and Messaging System

A graph structure to represent connections between nodes (e.g., users in a network).
Supports:
Adding nodes and edges.
Finding nodes.
Managing connections between users.
RSA Encryption
Generates RSA public and private keys.
Encrypts and decrypts messages using the RSA algorithm.
Includes functionality for serializing/deserializing keys to/from PEM format.
Run-Length Encoding (RLE) (Work in Progress)
A compression technique to encode strings by representing consecutive characters as their counts.

Getting Started
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or later.
Install required libraries:

pip install cryptography

2. To run the test files, please edit the file path on your computer next to sys.path.append on your computer to 
properly run. It did not want to import the normal way for some seriously messed up reason.
